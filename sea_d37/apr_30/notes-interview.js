// Paraphrase the problem in your own words.
// Ask questions - Do you have to many any assumptions? Don't! Ask instead. What info do you need and not have?
// Draw out examples to find the "edge cases" (where we throw monkey wrenches into our proposed implementation)
// Trace your code, line by line, noring (on the board) how variables change.
// Discuss complexity of your implementation and volunteer an analysis of your code.
