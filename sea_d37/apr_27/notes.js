    Node operates in an implicit IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), so do not worry about creating something
    and having it pollute the global scope.

    Node Globals:
        > require()
        > module.exports / exports
        > process

    REPL - Read > Evaluate > Print > Loop
    You can enter the NODE REPL via:
    $ node
    (press)

    "Red, Green, Refactor" is the process of writing code in order to get it to work and look how you want, then modify
    it so that it passes testing, and refactor it to look good again.
